## Description
This github webpage is for the "GitHub Pages Portfolio Assignment".  It is a project that displays information on the portfolio of the work I've been doing throughout this class.  There is a main page with a video introduction.  A page for Bio and information about me and lastly a page to view some of my project work. 

## How to run 
This page can be deployed on any web server if zipped and deployed to the directory

## Future Enhancements
Given more time we could better style this page using more bootstrap techniques, add additional pages to the tab bar and alot more.
